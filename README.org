* Lein-droid "lein new" template

  This small wrapper allows to create new lein-droid projects without having
  lein-droid in the =:plugins= list in =profiles.clj=. It downloads the latest
  version of lein-droid and passes the arguments to =lein droid new=. Once the
  project is created, it will already have lein-droid in =:plugins=, so you
  won't have to add that line manually neither in =project.clj=, nor in
  =profiles.clj=.

  Usage example:

  : lein new droid my-app com.company.myapp :app-name MyApplication :target-sdk 18

  It is equivalent to calling =lein droid new= with the same arguments.

  You can also do =lein new droid :init=  as a substitute for =lein droid init=.
